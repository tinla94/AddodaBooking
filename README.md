**Demo**: https://overnightbooking.online

Overnightbooking is a friendly hotel/room/condo/house booking web-application for everyone to share their place for rent or rent out a place from people around the world. 

# Fullstack Application

I built a Full-stack Application, using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), a framework that have been popular around web-deveopment world.

## Back-End

1. **Nodejs**: a platform built on Chromeâ€™s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, and thus perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

2. **Express.js**: a Node.js framework. You can create the server and server-side code for an application like most of the other web languages but using JavaScript.

3. **PM2**: a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.


## Front-End

4. **Bootstrap**: a CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

5. **React**: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

6. **Redux**: an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.

7. **React-Reveal**: a high performance animation library for React.


## Database

8. **MongoDB**: a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema. 

9. **Redis**: an open-source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

## APIs

10. **AWS S3**: a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface.

11. **Google Map API**: a robust tool that can be used to create a custom map, a searchable map, check-in functions, display live data synching with location, plan routes, or create a mashup just to name a few.

12. **Disqus**: an add-on tools for site owners to power discussions, increase engagement, and earn revenue.


# Getting Started

To get you started you can clone the repository to your local machine: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tinla94/OvernightBooking

```

### Or

```
Download the repository
```

Also decide whether you will use `yarn` or `npm`.  My preference is `npm` and what the app was built on.  

**For npm**: Run `npm install` on both **server** and **client**.

**For yarn**: Run `yarn add` on both **server** and **client**.

### Prerequisites

To run, first make sure you have Node installed. You can type `node -v` to find your version:

```
$ node -v 
v13.5.0
```

If you do not have Node installed. You can download from their website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or you can install via Homebrew (need to install Homebrew first fo course). Here's a link to a guide: https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew

You will also need to have mongoDB for database management. I few options for you.

1. Start your local mongodb. Make sure you install mongoDB before starting below command

```
mongod
```

2. You can use **MongoAtlas** for virtual database.

Please look at `package.json` file for all dependencies that you will need to install.  For example you will need *parcel-bundler* which can be installed via npm.


# Deployment

1. **Digital Ocean**: provides developers cloud services that help to deploy and scale applications that run simultaneously on multiple computers.

2. **namecheap**:  an ICANN-accredited domain registrar and technology company.

3. **Cloudflare**: a web-infrastructure and website-security company, providing content-delivery-network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security, and distributed domain-name-server services
